 MineSweeper game we will briefly review the rules here.
 
The games is played on a M by N grid of `cells', each of which is either empty or contains an explosive mine. 
the task (should you choose to accept it) is to locate all of the mines without causing any of them to explode.

TEST CASES:
Minecount cannot be less than zero
The matrix should a square conventially
The minecount cannot be greater than the size
wHILE comparing the neighbours making sure out of bounds

In this code I havent tried if the matrix is huge though.
